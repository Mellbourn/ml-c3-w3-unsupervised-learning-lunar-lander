# Lunar Lander final lab in Machine Learning Specialization

Note: I ultimately failed to get this to work on macOS

## installation

Does not have to be pip installed: time base64 random itertools

Installed Pillow instead of PIL.Image

On macOS I commented out the virtual display
# Display(visible=0, size=(840, 480)).start()
